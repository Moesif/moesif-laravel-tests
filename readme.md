Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

## How to Test
1. Manually clone the git repo.
2. Install all the dependencies by `composer install` or `composer update`.
3. Add your own application id to `config/moesif.php`. You can find your Application Id from [_Moesif Dashboard_](https://www.moesif.com/) -> _Top Right Menu_ -> _Installation_
4. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the repo.
5. Invoke `./vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the tests.
